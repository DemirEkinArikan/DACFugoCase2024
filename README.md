# Revenue Prediction from In-Game User Data

This project is focused on predicting the total revenue that users will generate in their first 90 days, based on the first 15 days of their in-game behavior.


## Files Description

- **example_data/**: This directory contains example datasets (limited to the first 10k rows).
  - `users_train.csv`: User metadata including device information, country, and platform data.
  - `user_features_train.csv`: First 15 days of user in-game behavior including levels completed, ad revenue, and IAP revenue.
  - `targets_train.csv`: Total revenue generated by each user in the first 90 days (the target variable).
  
- **best_prediction.csv**: The best prediction results, containing two columns: `ID` (the user ID) and `TARGET` (the predicted day-90 revenue).
  
- **DAC24.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file containing the code to load the data, preprocess it, build models, and make predictions.
  
- **presentation.pptx**: A PowerPoint presentation providing a summary of the project, the problem being addressed, methodology, and results.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of the following key features:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **User Metadata**: Includes device information (platform, device brand, model), geographic information (country), and timestamps (first open dates).
- **In-Game Behavior**: Tracks user activity for the first 15 days, including retention, levels played, revenue generated from ads and in-app purchases.
- **Target Variable**: Total revenue generated by the user within their first 90 days.

## Model

The model was built using a combination of user metadata and in-game behavior features. We optimized for **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**, aiming to minimize the error between predicted and actual revenues.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. To run the analysis, open the DAC24.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. To make predictions on the test dataset, ensure the files are in place in the example_data folder and run the prediction cells in the notebook.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). Lower RMSE indicates better predictive performance.
